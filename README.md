# Password-Generator

In this challenge I was tasked with creating a password generator using information I've recently learned regarding JavaScript. I had to create

a password that randomly generated on a scale of 8 to 128 characters using lower case, upper case, numbers and special characters.

## Accessing & using the webpage

To access the webpage just click follow this link http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html, you may have to use (ctrl + left mouse click) to activate the link

from there you just click generate password and you'll immediately be prompted with 5 questions, the final being how many characters you want your

password to be. after typing a number in you're given a randomly generated password.

## Process and thoughts

Continuing this little tradition I've had for the past few assignments, I'll give my thought process while working on the challenge. Going into this 

assignment I wasn't the most confident with "for statements", "if/else statements" or functions. I can't say I have complete confidence now but I most

certainly feel familiar with what I'm doing now. The benefit to being in a three month coding bootcamp is the lessons are stacked on top of the challenges

you're given so there's basically no time for concepts you've learned to fade from memory, conversely though sometimes you might need a bit more time to 

nail a concept down but it's time to move on to the next thing. Despite that I have learned a bit in spite of feeling like I haven't learned much of anything

at all. These challenges are a reminder of that.
